## GCS: Google Cloud Storage 

* [Google Storage : Making Data Public](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public)

* In this lab I included a `./lab-content/` directory that has a empty text file and some memes I enjoy to upload, edit permissions, move and delete in the cloud.  Feel Free to use them as you like.
